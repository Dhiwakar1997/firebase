          is a technology enthusiast, a problem solver and a computer geek. He
          is just 16 years old with very broad shoulders to take on any
          responsibility. He is the “designer” and “creator” of the product CPA
          Sage right from the stage of ideation, conceptualization, design and
          end-to-end development. His eye for detail, efficiency, being
          well-organized, agility, and simplicity (traits that he inherits from
          his parents) are visible throughout this feature-rich product, making
          it a very ‘smart’, ‘intelligent’ yet easy to use system.

        <div class="story__detail">
          Nidhi Jain CPA, being one of the most recognized and sought after CPA
          firm in the bay area, made Nidhi an extremely busy CPA during the tax
          season. Although the firm was on a home-grown efficient technology
          platform, it was far away from the needs and requirements of Nidhi, a
          tech-savvy CPA. She wanted to only focus on her client’s financial
          well-being leaving the rest of the tracking and practice management to
          the platform, but in vain. Having a varied experience, she realized
          that there is no platform available in the market that would solve her
          problems and meet her needs. She threw a challenge to her son,
          Divyansh, if he can help her achieve a dual mandate of a robust growth
          and maintain work-life balance, at the same time. Being an
          accomplished programmer and a problem solver, he took up the challenge
          chin-up and built a complete working product within a record time of 6
          months satisfying and far exceeding the requirements of a very
          demanding CPA. His design was so adaptive, that the mother-son duo
          wanted to “productize” the platform and help ease the life of all
          practising CPA. It gave birth to a product conceptualized by a CPA for
          the CPAs. The rest, as they say, is history.
